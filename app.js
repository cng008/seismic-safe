/** LOGIC FOR SENDING EARTHQUAKE MESSAGES
 *  need to ensure messages are only sent AFTER time of user registration.
 *
 *  user enters phone/location --> saved in to database
 *  our server would request earthquake data every 5-10 min
 *
 * keep track of last few entries from previous data so that when we get new data we know where to start looping.
 *  --> we'll search for previous data in new response data and start our loop from that index
 *
 *  loop through new earthquake entries
 *  --> if the magnitude reading is 4 or less, we do not need to continue with current iteration of loop. no message to be sent.
 * 	--> otherwise, if 5 or above, for each location, we'll search our database for users which have the same city location AND have a registration time before the time the earthquake was recorded. (ensures we don't message people old quake data for that day)
 *  --> send text message to matching users of earthquake depending on magnitude severity level
 *
 *  Message should include only these properties from API response:
 *  - place
 *  - time (updated to human readable from unix)
 *  - magnitude
 *  - url --> for more info (URL only for magnitude 6 and up to keep texts short)
